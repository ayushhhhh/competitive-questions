Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].


#CODE

def twoNumberSum(array, targetSum):
	return Result(array, targetSum)
def Result(array, targetSum):
	values = {}
	for n in array:
		match = targetSum - n
		if match in values:
			return[match,n]
		else:
			values[n] = True
			
	return[]
